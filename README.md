# These are some example C-CDAs created by John D'Amore of Diameter Health. 

Not all samples have been approved by HL7 Example Task Force, you should go here for official examples

## What's in this repo: 
* In the primary directory, there are a bunch of C-CDA 1.1 samples. This standard has been superceded by C-CDA 2.1, so I'd recommend going to that folder. I can't change the paths of existing files since the ONC links to this repo. 
* In the folder C-CDAR2.1 are the newer samples 

The reason why we include complete files above is so that we can validate the XML using industry standard tools, such as the NIST TT Validator. 

## Why?
*Lots* of people have implemented CCDA and it's the primary document standard in Meaningful Use

Here are two repos of examples from real EHRs (not real patient data)
C-CDA2.1: https://github.com/jddamore/ccda-samples
C-CDA1.1: https://github.com/chb/sample_ccdas)
