# These are some example C-CDAs created by John D'Amore of Diameter Health. 

## Not all samples have been approved by HL7 Example Task Force, so check out the http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=CDA_Example_Task_Force to see where things are. See http://www.diameterhealth.com for more information on me and what I'm working on. 

### What's here now
* 6 examples of allergies (+1 complete CCDA file)
* 1 example of care plan (missing complete CCDA file)
* 1 example of demographics (+1 complete CCDA file)
* 2 examples of functional and cognitive status (+2 complete CCDA files)
* 6 examples of lab results (+2 complete CCDA files)
* 9 examples of medications (+1 complete CCDA file)
* 1 example of a problem (+1 complete CCDA file)
* 4 examples of procedures (+1 complete CCDA file)
* 3 examples of smoking history (+1 complete CCDA file)
* 2 examples of vital signs (+1 complete CCDA file)

The reason why we include complete files above is so that we can validate the XML using industry standard tools, such as the NIST TT Validator. 

### Why?
*Lots* of people have implemented C-CDA and it's the primary document standard in MU2 and now MU3.
