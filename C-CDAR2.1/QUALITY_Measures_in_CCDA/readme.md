C-CDA 2.1 Example: NA (QRDA1 Example 2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.24.3.97 and 2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.24.3.98)

Validation location: HL7 Schematron (Diameter Health hosted) February 15, 2018

Comments: This is an example of how one could report quality measures in a C-CDA document. It is not a C-CDA template, but could be included as a section (since open template) and is conformant to QRDA1 Measure Section constraints. It would not be appropriate for US QRDA submission.
