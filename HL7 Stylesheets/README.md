## Stylesheets

These are default stylesheets for C-CDA documents. 

The "CDA.xsl" file is the current (as of 2019) stylehseet distributed by HL7 with C-CDA 2.1 package (US specific). Instructions on how to are available at: https://github.com/HL7/cda-core-xsl

The file which is named "CDA_old_HL7_stylesheet" is the version widely distributed before 2019. It has the yellow and cyan colors which many are familiar with but is no longer maintained by HL7. 

You should refer to HL7 repositories for up-to-date stylesheets and documentation. These are used here sfor testing of samples.
